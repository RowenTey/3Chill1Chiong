      "This research paper by P. Samay from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, focuses on forecasting the prices of alternative assets. It was published in 2021 and is available for download from the website DR-NTU.This paper summarises the aim to establish a causal relationship between pairs of cryptocurrencies and utilise the information to forecast returns with the help of a novel OLS-LSTM model. The practicality of this approach is further tested by implementing a simple trading strategy based on the signals generated by the model. Research from previous studies is discussed, as well as the data collection and cleaning process.Transform (FFT) and autocorrelations are also \n",

      "Page 3 summarises the process of collating and presenting summary statistics for cryptocurrency time series in Figure 2 and Figure 3, as well as the methodology used to employ the use of an RLM-LSTM hybrid model. This model is composed of four main components - finding the best cointegrated Granger causal pair, regressing the predictor on the response series, taking the residuals of the regression and using them as input to an LSTM model, and combining the RLM and LSTM forecasts into a series. Additionally, the tests that are performed are outlined, such as normality, endogeneity and heteroskedasticity.\n",
      "Page 4 discusses the implementation of a hybrid RLM-LSTM model to better forecast a cryptocurrency series. The model consists of pre-processing steps, including clipping noisy observations and residual transformation, followed by two LSTM layers and fully connected layers. The forecasted values and predicted residuals are then combined and re-scaled back to the original scale before comparing to a naïve model. The results show that the model achieves a lower MAPE than the naïve model with an rMAPE of 0.684.\n",

      "This paper discussed the use of a hybrid model combining a RidgeLinear Regression with a Long-Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network for predicting cryptocurrency prices. A trading strategy was simulated, resulting in a 15.16% return within a year with an initial cash amount of 10,000$. The strategies suggest the best strategy for the test period was to buy the asset which is justified by the bull run of cryptocurrencies in 2020. Further research looking into rolling and expanding models and ensembles are suggested.\n",
