Richman et al (2005) and Perrin et al (2009) have conducted surveys that revealed stress- and-coping processes amongst medical students in Singapore, influenced by Asian culture and medical school culture. Karam et al (2008) found that college students used emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies, with effective strategies being planning/problem-solving, seeking instrumental social support, positive reappraisal, acceptance, venting emotions, and relaxation. Markus and Kitayama (1991) also emphasised the importance of cultural context, as well as factors such as stressors and coping behaviours during stressful encounters.
