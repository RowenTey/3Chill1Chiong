COVID-19 is typically transmitted via contact with respiratory droplets and fomites and is more likely to be airborne during certain procedures. To help reduce contamination, some hospitals have created alternate OR complexes for COVID-19 cases. In Singapore, one anaesthetist, surgical doctor and unit nurse are required to wear N95 masks and eye protection during intubation in the OR, and a 14-18 minute waiting period post-procedure before staff and visitors can enter the room again.
