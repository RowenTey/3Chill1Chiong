This project aims to investigate techniques for implementing interactive input and output for online coding platforms, to better facilitate programming course requirements. Two techniques were tested and results and future work were discussed, considering the message exchanging and parsing overhead as a performance consideration. Acknowledgement was also given to associated funding and guidance from Nanyang Technological University and Assoc. Prof. Hui Siu Cheung. 
This project aims to investigate techniques to implement interactive input and output on an online programming platform, so users can program and practice with transparent test cases. Two techniques were studied in order to evaluate the performance of the Websocket protocol and consider message exchanging and parsing overhead as performance considerations. Acknowledgement was given to the generous support, advice, and guidance from Nanyang Technological University URECA Undergraduate Research Programme and Assoc Prof. Hui Siu Cheung. 
This project aims to investigate techniques to implement interactive input and output on an online programming platform to help students learn programming quickly and effectively. Two techniques were tested, difficulties were discussed, and relevant work that could be carried out in future was provided. Funding and guidance was received from Nanyang Technological University and Assoc. Prof. Hui Siu Cheung.
