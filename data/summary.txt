Four recent studies reveal some sources of stress among medical students and their associated coping behaviours. There is evidence suggesting that Asian culture and medical school culture can influence their stress and coping. Our exploratory pilot study observed 32 students across the 4 years and reported positive reappraisal, acceptance, venting emotions and relaxation as effective coping strategies. Additionally, Firth-Cozens and Greenhalgh's study further examines the relationship between stress and lowered clinical care.
